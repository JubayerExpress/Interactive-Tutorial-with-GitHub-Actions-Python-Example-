# Python Interactive Tutorial

Welcome to this interactive Python tutorial!

## How it works:
1. Fork this repository.
2. Modify the `solutions/user_solution.py` file to complete the functions.
3. Submit a pull request with your solution.
4. GitHub Actions will automatically run tests on your solution.

## Functions to complete:
- `add(a, b)`: Return the sum of `a` and `b`.
- `subtract(a, b)`: Return the difference when `b` is subtracted from `a`.

## Running tests locally:
If you want to test your solution locally before submitting:
1. Install `pytest` by running `pip install pytest`.
2. Run `pytest` in the project directory to check your solution.
